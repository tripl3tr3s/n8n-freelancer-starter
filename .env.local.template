# ===== IMPORTANT NOTES =====
# 1. These credentials are ONLY for YOUR personal n8n course enrollment
# 2. They won't work for other users deploying this template
# 3. Use these ONLY in workflows when completing course exercises
# 4. For production client work, you won't need these credentials
# 5. DO NOT set these as Railway environment variables - keep them local only
# 6. When creating course workflows, use them as hardcoded values or n8n credentials

# ===== USAGE IN WORKFLOWS =====
# Option 1: Store in n8n Credentials (recommended)
#   - Go to n8n UI > Credentials > Add Credential > "Header Auth" or "Generic"
#   - Enter your course API key there
#   - Reference in workflow nodes
#
# Option 2: Hardcode in workflow (less secure, but OK for learning)
#   - Use the values above directly in HTTP Request nodes
#   - Only do this for course exercises, never for production

# ===== SETUP INSTRUCTIONS =====
# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.local.template .env.local
# 2. Fill in your credentials from the n8n course email
# 3. Use the credentials in your n8n workflows (see options above)
